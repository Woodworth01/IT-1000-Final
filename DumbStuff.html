<h1> Dumb Things We Did</h1>

<p> sometimes my friends and I will be bored and not really know what to do. so we will try our best to entertain ourself. we have just off some bridges into a body of water and have broken into abandon buildings to sxplore what mistories await inside. over thanks giving break, my friends and i broke into a 12 story abandon building and played hide and go seek inside of it. that was so much fun i hope to go back there again. </p>

<p> we have stollen traffic signs and kept them hidden in our basement, but the object that really takes the cake is the time where we stole a parking meeter. after we stole it we realized we didnt actually want it. so i gave it to my friends little brother and now it just sits in their basement.</p>
