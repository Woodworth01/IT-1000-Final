<h1>My First Year of College</h1>

<p>My name is John Woodworth, and I go to the University of Missouri - Columbia. I have made many new friends, and have had some core memories made in the short time that ive been here. my goal for the next three years is to study hard and do well in class while also having the time to do fun things and not stress all over school. Though coding can be hard sometimes, I will try my best to maintain the knowledge I am given and use it in real world issues that involve code. I hope to have a good time while im here for the next few years, and I've been told that it goes by faster than highschool. So I plan to make every moment count.  </p>
