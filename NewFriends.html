<h1> Making New Friends</h1>

<p> making new friends has always been farely easy for me. i like to think that i am just good at talking to people. and i figured that everyone else was also in the same boat as i was and also looking for people to talk too. so i just started to talk to everyone, and im still friends with some of those people i met on the first week of school. others have found their own group and have gone to do something different. i dont think i have a specific friend group. i like to hang out with different groups to have different diversities. one of my friend groups like to play soccer, which is something that i love to do, while the other friend group likes to go out on hikes and be active. </p>
