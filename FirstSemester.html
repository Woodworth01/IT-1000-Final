<h1> My First Semester </h1> 
<p> My first semester was very enjoyable for the most part. I went through a break up which was very difficult for me to adjust to, but soon I was bale to grab myself back and become the happy person i'm known to be.   </p>
<p> During my  first smester of school, i played Flag Football. it was so much fun. i hadnt ever played football before, and i ended up not being too bad at it. it definitly helped that I was faster than most of the team. </p>
<p> Last semester was my first time trying any IT stuff and i found it mostly entertaining. but i think im going to switch it too a minor becuase i dont think ill be good enough to make it all the way to the end.</p>

<p> Here are my grades from last semester</p>
